My name is Nikita Lanskov, and I’m from Saint Petersburg. I studied at Lyceum No. 144 and transferred to Lyceum No. 30 in the ninth grade. I consider this one of the best decisions I’ve made, as I have never encountered anything more advanced in terms of education and environment.

I completed my bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics at the Polytechnic Institute. I also enrolled in the master’s program there but did not defend my thesis.

In my second year of university, I started an internship with my algorithms professor. Since then, we've been working together at [ITS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/itsxyz/). In November 2021, I joined the Russian branch of EPAM as a senior engineer. In March 2022, I relocated to Turkey with the company and have been living in Izmir ever since.

My *ikigai* is to improve my life and the world around me by optimizing all processes that can be brought under control.

At work, I set up efficient CI/CD processes, automate routine tasks, visualize workflows, and structure them into a clear pipeline. In everyday life, I find the most joy in being prepared for any turn of events—when my potential energy is at its peak.

Also, I have a lot of hobbies! Cycling, Guitar playing, hiking. I used to go to be a water tourist every summer when I lived in Saint-Petersburg. But right now my focus is more on notetaking and undirected research. I fall in love with Digital Garden concept, so I created one for me to share my planted ideas.
