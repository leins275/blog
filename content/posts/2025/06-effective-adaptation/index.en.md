I constantly change my task management system — and it's not by accident.

Depending on the current pace of life, it makes sense to use different systems. You can compare it to professional sports, where athletes use different gear and equipment depending on the weather conditions. In the same way, I continuously adjust my system to fit the current reality.

The process of change itself should also be systematized so that it doesn't consume too much energy. For example, you can prepare different presets. During calm periods, one list might be enough; during intense workloads, you can increase the number of lists and organizational elements, such as tags and project sections.

An effective system requires minimal effort to maintain and delivers maximum productivity gains. That’s why a powerful and flexible setup designed for high-activity periods is completely unsuitable for quieter times. So, I’ve come to realize that it’s useful to be familiar with various systems and approaches — and to know when to switch between them.
