In investing, two main approaches are distinguished: fundamental analysis and technical analysis.  
Fundamental analysis relies on economic indicators and allows for strategic assessments over a long planning horizon.  
Technical analysis, on the other hand, is based on the asset’s price chart. It enables tactical predictions over a short-term horizon.  
A rough estimate of fundamental analysis is relatively simple.  
Successful use of technical analysis requires constant attention and a high level of competence.

A similar principle exists in chess.  
If you find yourself in an unfamiliar position, a good strategy is simply to make good moves.

These thoughts were prompted by reflections on purchases.  
Just good things I’ve bought bring daily satisfaction when used.  
But if a purchase was made based on some tactical impulse, it almost always turned out to be a useless item—too good to throw away, but impossible to sell.

There’s a common pattern in all of this:  
The higher your level of expertise and understanding of the situation, the more risk you can reasonably afford to take.
