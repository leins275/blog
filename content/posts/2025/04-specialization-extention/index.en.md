Everyone is waiting for artificial intelligence to replace IT specialists. I believe IT specialists should *power up* with AI and become twice as effective.

More specifically, the scope of specialization should expand. It would be more convenient for businesses if, for example, frontend engineers also handled design. And backend developers could also take care of DevOps. I think AI makes this realistic.

What most project managers do is a mystery to me. It feels like they serve some kind of pointless bureaucracy. There's no reason not to combine business analysis, the scrum master role, and delivery oversight. And as for the documentation needed for bureaucrats—ChatGPT can easily handle that.

Narrow specialization can be useful, especially when it's relevant. But the more people are involved, the slower the project moves—communication overhead gets very high, even among people with strong soft skills. I believe in nearly all projects, expanding the specialization of each team member would only be beneficial.
