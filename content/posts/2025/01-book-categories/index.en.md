In his book, Margulan Seisembay identifies four main types of energy: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.
This kind of classification seems particularly interesting to me in the context of categorizing books. All books in a reading list can be divided into three categories:

- Emotional – entertaining literature aimed at increasing emotional energy.
- Spiritual – books that raise overall spirituality and erudition. Education without a specific request. More complex fiction, philosophical texts.
- Mental – reading for self-education. This requires the highest level of concentration and effort. It involves seeking answers to specific questions.

Such a classification helps in choosing a book depending on one’s current mood and needs.
