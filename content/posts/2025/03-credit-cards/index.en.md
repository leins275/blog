# May Discoveries

## Credit Cards

I recently discovered how credit cards actually work. I had always thought that the only difference between a credit and a debit card was that, if you had no money in your account, a credit card would let you cover the shortfall using a credit limit. Other than that, I assumed it worked just like a debit card. But it turns out that a credit card **always** uses the credit limit for payments! And a debit card, of course, only uses the funds from your account. Genius! (*Nikita, 26 years old*)

## Sneakers

I bought myself a pair of trekking sneakers, liked them so much that I got another pair, and now I wear only those. Trekking sneakers are ideologically designed for long walks, so they're the best thing you can get for strolls — whether long or short.

## Hackathons

For the past couple of months, my colleagues and I have been preparing a hackathon in Portugal. Over the last five years, one of my professional focuses has been developing and maintaining a digital platform for hackathons. However, despite my extensive experience, independently organizing an event has brought many interesting challenges to our small team.
Come [join us at the hackathon](https://l.xthon.eu/) on June 13–14 to see how we tackled those challenges! You’ll also meet new people and solve one of three interesting cases. And if you happen to be in Lisbon — you’ve got a unique opportunity to attend our hackathon offline!
