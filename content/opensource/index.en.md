# [hugo-coder theme](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder)

I am in a list of contributors to hugo-coder hugo theme, that is used in this website.

I needed Yandex Metrika support, so I added it and the author merged my small change.

# [CRAN parser](https://github.com/leins275/cran-parser)

This project I did as a test task for the EPAM project. 
The goal was to build a full list of the R dependencies based on CRAN website.
This thing is required for EasyBuild R language bundling.

I successfully passed the test, but finally I went to the [different project](/projects/gctocbot/) that wants me more.

# [Sanctions check](https://github.com/MikhailFokanov/sanctions-check)

This project I contributed in EPAM. We did a PoC for validating if name exists in sanctions list. 
Also there were some ChatGPT api integration to process data.

Stack: OpenSearch, Python, ChatGPT API
