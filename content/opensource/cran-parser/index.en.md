This project I did as a test task for the EPAM project. 
The goal was to build a full list of the R dependencies based on CRAN website.
This thing is required for EasyBuild R language bundling.

I successfully passed the test, but finally I went to the [different project](/projects/gctocbot/) that wants me more.
