While working on the platform, our team also provided technical support to the organizers on all related issues. At some point, it became necessary to automate this process to reduce the workload on the support team and simultaneously make it easier for organizers to request help from us.

To achieve this, we developed a dedicated Telegram bot that integrates with Todoist via API.

The workflow is as follows:
- Organizers message the bot, receive notifications about comments, and can view all their requests in one place.
- All support agents receive notifications from the bot about new requests. Whoever is available picks up the ticket. It's a pull-based processing system.
- All tickets are also created in Todoist on the support board. Support agents use this board as their main interface.
- The system supports communication through ticket comments â€” users write comments in Telegram related to their request, and support agents read and respond via comments in the corresponding Todoist ticket.
